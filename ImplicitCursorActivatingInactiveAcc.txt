17(a) Implicit Cursor: Activating Inactive Accounts
In this PL/SQL block, we'll use an implicit cursor to update the status of bank accounts that have been marked as inactive for more than 365 days. The block will also display an appropriate message based on the number of rows affected using %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, and %ROWCOUNT.
