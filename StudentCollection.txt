1. Create the Student Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Roll_No VARCHAR(10),
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Class VARCHAR(10),
    Marks INT,
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    Enrolled_Courses VARCHAR(255)
);
2. Insert 10 records into the Student Table:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Student (Roll_No, Name, Class, Marks, Address, Enrolled_Courses)
VALUES
    ('A1', 'Alice', 'SE', 80, 'Street 1', 'DBMS,TOC'),
    ('A2', 'Bob', 'SE', 60, 'Street 2', 'DBMS,OS'),
    ('A3', 'Charlie', 'TE', 45, 'Street 3', 'DBMS,TOC'),
    ('A4', 'David', 'TE', 55, 'Street 4', 'TOC,AI'),
    ('A5', 'Eve', 'BE', 90, 'Street 5', 'DBMS,AI'),
    ('A6', 'Frank', 'BE', 50, 'Street 6', 'DBMS,AI'),
    ('A7', 'Grace', 'BE', 30, 'Street 7', 'DBMS,TOC'),
    ('A8', 'Hank', 'TE', 70, 'Street 8', 'DBMS,AI'),
    ('A9', 'Ivy', 'SE', 75, 'Street 9', 'DBMS,TOC'),
    ('A10', 'Jack', 'SE', 95, 'Street 10', 'AI,TOC');
3. List the names of students who have enrolled in the course “DBMS”, “TOC”.
sql
Copy code
SELECT Name 
FROM Student
WHERE FIND_IN_SET('DBMS', Enrolled_Courses) > 0 
AND FIND_IN_SET('TOC', Enrolled_Courses) > 0;
FIND_IN_SET is used to check if the student is enrolled in both "DBMS" and "TOC".
4. List the Roll numbers and class of students who have marks more than 50 or class as TE.
sql
Copy code
SELECT Roll_No, Class 
FROM Student
WHERE Marks > 50 OR Class = 'TE';
This query uses OR to find students with marks greater than 50 or who belong to the "TE" class.
5. Update the entire record of Roll_No "A10".
sql
Copy code
UPDATE Student 
SET Name = 'John', 
    Class = 'BE', 
    Marks = 85, 
    Address = 'Street 20', 
    Enrolled_Courses = 'DBMS,AI'
WHERE Roll_No = 'A10';
This query updates the record of student with Roll_No = 'A10'.
6. Display the names of students having 3rd and 4th highest marks.
sql
Copy code
SELECT Name
FROM Student
ORDER BY Marks DESC
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
LIMIT with OFFSET is used to skip the top two records and return the next two, which are the 3rd and 4th highest.
7. Delete the records of students having marks less than 20.
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE Marks < 20;
This deletes all records where the marks are less than 20.
8. Delete only the first record from the collection.
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Student
ORDER BY Roll_No
LIMIT 1;
This deletes the first student based on the Roll_No order. If you have a specific column (e.g., an ID) for ordering, you can adjust the ORDER BY clause accordingly.
