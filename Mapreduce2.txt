To solve the given queries using MapReduce in MongoDB, we first need to import the zip.json collection and then calculate the total population in each state. Below is a detailed guide on how to do that:

1. Import zip.json to MongoDB
Assuming that you have a JSON file zip.json which contains information about cities and their populations, you can import it into MongoDB using the mongoimport command.

In the terminal, run the following command to import the data:

bash
Copy code
mongoimport --db DYPIT --collection zip --file zip.json --jsonArray
This will import the zip.json file into the DYPIT database and create the zip collection.

2. Find the Total Population in Each State Using MapReduce
Now that we have the data imported, we will write a MapReduce query to calculate the total population for each state.

Map Function:
The map function will emit the state as the key and the population as the value for each document.

Reduce Function:
The reduce function will sum up the populations for each state.

MapReduce Code:
javascript
Copy code
var map = function() {
  // Emit state as the key and the population as the value
  emit(this.state, this.population);
};

var reduce = function(key, values) {
  // Sum the populations for each state
  return Array.sum(values);
};

// Run the MapReduce operation
db.zip.mapReduce(map, reduce, { out: { inline: 1 } });
Explanation:
Map: For each document, we emit the state (this.state) as the key and the population (this.population) as the value. This creates a key-value pair for each city, where the key is the state and the value is the population.

Reduce: The reduce function aggregates the populations by summing them up for each state. Array.sum(values) is used to sum the array of population values for each state.

Output: The result will be returned inline, showing the total population for each state.

Example Output:
json
Copy code
[
  { "_id": "KS", "value": 500000 },
  { "_id": "NY", "value": 1000000 },
  { "_id": "CA", "value": 2500000 }
]
This output shows the total population for each state. Each document has an _id field (which corresponds to the state) and a value field (which represents the total population for that state).

Conclusion:
Using MapReduce in MongoDB, we can easily calculate the total population for each state in the collection. The steps include:

Importing the zip.json data using mongoimport.
Creating a MapReduce function that emits the state and population, and then reduces the population by summing the values for each state.
This is an efficient way to perform aggregation in MongoDB when you need to group and summarize data based on specific criteria (in this case, by state).
