To solve the given queries using MapReduce in MongoDB, we need to work with a collection that stores documents with fields like id, name, email, work, age, gender, Salary, and hobbies. Below is how we can use MapReduce to answer the queries.

1. Get the Count of Males and Females
Map Function:
The map function will emit the gender field for each document, counting how many males and how many females are present.

Reduce Function:
The reduce function will aggregate the counts for each gender.

MapReduce for Counting Males and Females:
javascript
Copy code
var map = function() {
  // Emit gender as the key
  emit(this.gender, 1);
};

var reduce = function(key, values) {
  // Sum the counts for each gender
  return Array.sum(values);
};

// Run the MapReduce operation
db.collection.mapReduce(map, reduce, { out: { inline: 1 } });
Explanation:
Map: For each document, we emit the gender (either "Male" or "Female") as the key and a value of 1 to count each occurrence.
Reduce: The reduce function simply sums up the values for each gender (i.e., counting how many times each gender appears).
Output: We output the result inline, so the result is directly returned without being stored in a collection.
Example Output:
json
Copy code
[
  { "_id": "Male", "value": 1 },
  { "_id": "Female", "value": 0 }
]
This result shows the count of males and females in the collection.

2. Count the Number of Users in Each Hobby
The hobbies field contains a comma-separated list of hobbies, so we need to split the hobbies into individual elements and then count how many times each hobby appears.

Map Function:
The map function will split the hobbies string into individual hobbies and emit each hobby as the key, with a value of 1.

Reduce Function:
The reduce function will aggregate the counts for each hobby.

MapReduce for Counting Hobbies:
javascript
Copy code
var map = function() {
  // Split the 'hobbies' string by commas to get an array of hobbies
  var hobbies = this.hobbies.split(',');
  
  // Emit each hobby as a key and count it with value 1
  hobbies.forEach(function(hobby) {
    emit(hobby.trim(), 1);  // trim to remove any leading or trailing spaces
  });
};

var reduce = function(key, values) {
  // Sum the values (counts) for each hobby
  return Array.sum(values);
};

// Run the MapReduce operation
db.collection.mapReduce(map, reduce, { out: { inline: 1 } });
Explanation:
Map: The map function splits the hobbies field into an array using split(',') and then emits each hobby with a value of 1.
Reduce: The reduce function sums the values (i.e., counts the number of occurrences of each hobby).
Output: The result is returned inline, showing the counts of each individual hobby.
Example Output:
json
Copy code
[
  { "_id": "Acrobatics", "value": 1 },
  { "_id": "Photography", "value": 1 },
  { "_id": "Papier-Mache", "value": 1 }
]
This result shows the count of each hobby in the collection. Each hobby is counted by how many times it appears in the hobbies field.
